In the method, we introduce 4 new AST-based metrics to provide richer information about the scale and complexity of code entities. They are as follows.  

**TreeDepth**(TD): The depth of the AST of a code entity. The more statements the code entity has, the more levels and more complex structure its AST. Thus, TD reflects the size and complexity of a code entity and can be used in code smell detection.  

**TreeWidth** (TW): The width of the AST of a code entity. It is similar to TD, the larger the scale of the code entity is, and the more the level nodes of its AST. So TW also can be used in scale-related code smell detection.  

**Number of Nodes** (NS): The total number of the nodes of the AST of a code entity. NS directly reflects the size of a code entity.  

**Maximum Number of Children** (MC): The maximum number of child nodes of the AST of a code entity. MC reflects the number of subordinate parts of the largest part of a code entity. For instance, a large class node contains too many method nodes. A large method node contains too many variable declaration nodes and statement nodes. A large MC indicates that a part of the code entity is too complicated which violates development principles.

In BMCo-O, **Code smell data set** now verifiably uses the Palomba dataset. Because lots of co-occurrence relation data among code smells in Palomba dataset has been investigated [19]. Based on the investigation data [19], there are six code-smell-co-occurrence impactor factors generated by **generating code-smells-co-occurrences impact factors sets**, as shown in Table 2. Then using Formula (2) to calculate the co-occurrence impact factor sets of seven code smells in **code smell type set**, as shown in Table 3.

## 5.Run the code

It is composed of the source code of BMCo-O, as well as the data for the evaluation. Tips:

1.baseline_1 is the original data
2.baseline_2 is the optimized data
3.extra is the added positive samples from optimization process
